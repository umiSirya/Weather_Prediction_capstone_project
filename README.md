# Problem Statement
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of skin cancer, sunburns, and other harmful effects on human health. While UV radiation levels fluctuate based on location, time of day, and weather conditions, many individuals lack the awareness and tools to effectively manage their sun exposure. This gap in knowledge and accessibility results in preventable health issues and decreased quality of life.

UV Monitor & Sunscreen Guide addresses this issue by providing accurate, city-specific UV index predictions and personalized sunscreen recommendations. By leveraging real-time weather data and advanced machine learning algorithms, the project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sun exposure and skin protection, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing the risk of UV-related health problems.
