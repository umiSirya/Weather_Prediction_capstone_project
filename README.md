# UV Monitor & Sunscreen Guide
# <h2> Project Overview </h2>
In an age where sun safety is paramount, this project aims to provide individuals with accurate and timely predictions of UV index levels based on their city. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, this project analyzes real-time weather data to forecast UV index levels. Additionally, it offers personalized sunscreen recommendations to ensure optimal skin protection.

By seamlessly integrating data from weather APIs and predictive modeling, UV Predictor & SPF Guide empowers users to make informed decisions about sun exposure and skin care, enhancing public health and awareness.

# <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of skin cancer, sunburns, and other harmful effects on human health. While UV radiation levels fluctuate based on location, time of day, and weather conditions, many individuals lack the awareness and tools to effectively manage their sun exposure. This gap in knowledge and accessibility results in preventable health issues and decreased quality of life.

The project addresses this issue by providing accurate, city-specific UV index predictions and personalized sunscreen recommendations. By leveraging real-time weather data and advanced machine learning algorithms, the project empowers users to make informed decisions about their sun exposure and skin protection, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing the risk of UV-related health problems.

<h3>Next Steps - Deploying UV Monitor & Sunscreen Guide</h3>
The next phase of my project involves deploying the UV Predictor & SPF Guide using Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. Streamlit will enable users to input their city and receive real-time UV index predictions along with personalized sunscreen recommendations. By leveraging this platform, we aim to enhance accessibility and ensure users can make informed decisions about their sun protection with ease.
